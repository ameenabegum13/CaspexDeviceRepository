Have used Mysql for the endpoint "Get all Devices for a given OS name"
EndPoint:
http://localhost:8080/devices/os/Windows

As the Aerospike is not allowing to fetch the data with column name query like find by OS name.

I tried to resolve to fetch by AerospikeRepository ,but facing Unsupported Server Feature.

Therefore i used Spring Data JpaRepository to fetch findByOsName.
